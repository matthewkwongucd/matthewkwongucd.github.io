      <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
      <p>Last week, my Design 157 class brainstormed topics for the IAMCR Beijing 2020
      competition. As a class, we did an affinity map and came up with many ideas,
       putting them into 5 categories: Social/Behavior, Tech Systems/Innovation, Issues, Inclusiveness, and Value/ Community</p>

      <p>What stuck out to me the most were the Social/Behavior and Systems/Innovation topics.

      </p>

      <p>Below is my topic brainstorming tree, showing some of the thoughts and ideas
        that I'm interested in finding a solution for.

      <p>The first thing that came to mind for me was Social Media. This to me is one of
      the biggest problems with our generation. There are so many problems and connections
    that social media entitles. Although, there are some positives like access to communication,
  there comes factors and problems like cyberbullying and lack of security to personal
information being posted online.<p>
  <p> This was a very personal topic because I've
been cyberbullied before and would never want someone else to feel what I went through.
For this reason, I want to create something based on that topic. I then built
my brainstorm around that and connected it to things I thought corresponded to the item above or
below, connecting them all to various topics and ideas.</p>
