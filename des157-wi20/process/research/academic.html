      <p>After doing research on cyberbullying and learning more about the effects and number of people affected, there has to be a change. With social media being used more than ever, it’s never been easier to bully someone. With social media and the use of being online, bullies no longer have to face their victims. With a smartphone or any mobile device, cyberbullying can occur.
      </p>

      <p>In a study done by the Pew Research Center, they found that, “59% of U.S. teens have been bullied or harassed online” (Pew Research Center). Additionally, they found that name calling was the most common form of cyberbullying and was most likely to occur to girls than boys. Cyberbullying is also more likely to occur to those of low income (Pew Research Center). It was impressive to find that “79% of teens say elected officials are doing only a fair or poor job of addressing this problem” (Pew research Center). With something so obvious, it’s disappointing to see that there’s not much being done to reduce cyberbullying by those with the most power. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed, but is clearly not getting enough attention as it should be. </p>

      <p>According to professor Sujung Cho from the Southern Illinois University Carbondale, she reports that often those bullied become bullies themselves (SIU Carbondale). With this finding, it shows that there’s potential to decrease the number of people being bullied if those bullying realize the damage they’re doing was similar to their own experience.</p>

      <p>
        The most disappointing piece of knowledge that I learned was that, “Although all states have laws requiring schools to respond to bullying, many states do not include cyberbullying under these laws or specify the role schools should play in responding to bullying that takes place outside of school” (StopBullying.org). This is ridiculous as it enables cyberbullying to continue in schools. Students are unsafe because teachers are unable to intervene due to the bullying happening away from school.
      </p>


      <p>	All in all, with this new learned evidence, I wish to stop bullying and do my part in making the internet a safer place for people to be part of.</p>
