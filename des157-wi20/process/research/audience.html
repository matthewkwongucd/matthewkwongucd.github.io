    <section>
      <p>Since doing my academic research on the problem of cyberbullying,
        I've come up with adjustments to my project. Due to the high amount of
        students in schools being bullied, I plan on developing an application
        that would allow students to communicate on a forum about bullying and
        have access to report bullies to school officials anonymously by
        screenshotting the content to teachers.
      </p>

      <p>This would differ from other applications out there becuase it would be a
        free application to use instead of a parental monitoring subscription service.</p>


      <p>While analying the potential user demographic, I would definitely say
         that this application is geared towards students.<p>

       <ul>
         <li>Student:
           <ul>
             <li>Age 10-18</li>
             <li>School</li>
             <li>Cyberbullied</li>
             <li>Likes:
              <ul>
                <li>Instagram</li>
                <li>Snapchat</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
           </ul>
         </li>
       </ul>
