      <h2>Good User Interface</h2>
      <p>Before building my own web application, I've decided to do some research
      on common applications that have great user interactions.</p>

      <p>Some commonly used applications amongst teenagers are <a href = "https://instagram.com">Instagram</a> and <a href = "https://youtube.com">YouTube</a>.</p>

      <h2>Instagram</h2>

      <p>I chose to analyze the social media platform because it is the platofrm where most
        people are cyberbullied on. Additionally, a lot of users use Instagram for
        self confidence based on the number of likes they get on a post.</p>

      <p>When first opening the mobile app, users are introduced to their home page
        where they're able to interact with posts from users they follow.
        The interactions on this page are fairly simple, users can either:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Check stories</li>
          <li>Scroll to see posts
            <ul>
              <li>Like Posts</li>
              <li>Comment</li>
              <li>Direct message the post to someone</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Explore Page</li>
          <li>Create Post</li>
          <li>Activity</li>
          <li>Profile</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Although there seems to be a lot of different interaction types,
        the Instagram feed experience and interaction is very simple and clear
      what each of the buttons do if the user taps on a post.
        <img src = "images/posts.gif" alt = "instagram home page" width = "300">
        There are some any mobile applications that have this inifinity type scroll feature as
        home pages to display the main content on their platform.
      </p>

      <p>Additionally, by adding a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen,
        it provides users with the other interactions they can have with the app.
        <img src = "images/nav.jpeg" alt = "instagram nav" width = "300">
        Here users can choose between their home page, explore page, make a post,
        see their activity, and check their own profile.
        </p>

      <h2>YouTube</h2>
      <p>While analyzing YouTube, there were many features to recognize.
        When first entering the app, user's are presented with videos that
        would best fit their viewing history. On the navigation bar, users are
        able to choose from their subscriptions, trending, or to check their own
        profile. At the top of the page is the search area, similar to Google searching.
        This search bar is very common in many applications so it's easy for users to
        quickly find it and get to the videos they're interested in watching.
        <img src = "images/youtube.jpg" alt = "youtube" width = "300"></p>


        <p>Once choosing a video to watch, users are presented with a like button,
        dislike, and subcribe button. This is followed by the comment section
      which can sometimes have very mean comments.
      <img src = "images/justin.jpg" alt = "youtube" width = "300">
     </p>




    <h2>Debrief</h2>
    <p>After analyzing both platforms, I think that both have great user interactions.
      I think Instagram is the better designed platform, because of its simplicity and
      ease of usability. The features are very common and easy to grasp. With
      YouTube it was often hard to navgate through different tabs and results with
      swiping to go back.

      <p>Both apps seemed very similar to one another in the sense that they had
        the infinity scroll type design and had comment sections.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I think that there needs to be some regulation
    in the comment sections of both applications. That is the source of many mean
  and hateful comments to content creators.</p>
